# AI330 Machine Learning Projects - Fall 2023

Welcome to our machine learning project repository for the AI330 course! This project involves implementing various machine learning models on numerical and image datasets.

## **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:
### `code/`
- Includes implementation code for machine learning models, organized into:
  - `numerical_regression/`: Implementations for Linear Regression & KNN.
  - `image_classification/`: Implementations for Logistic Regression & K-Means.

### `data/`
- Contains datasets used for numerical and image-based models.

### `docs/`
- Additional documentation, resources, or any supporting files.

### `results/`
- Output files showcasing model performance metrics, loss curves, accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Familiarity with machine learning algorithms and Python programming.

### **Usage**

1. **Data Preparation:** Place datasets in the `data/` directory.
2. **Model Implementation:** Utilize scripts in the respective `code/` directories for machine learning models.
3. **Analysis:** Review results and performance metrics in the `results/` directory.
